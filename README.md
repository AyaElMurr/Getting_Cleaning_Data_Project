# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Aya El Murr

This is a repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

## Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Please note that in order to run this code, you will need to change the working directory to your own. 

The tasks performed are: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
